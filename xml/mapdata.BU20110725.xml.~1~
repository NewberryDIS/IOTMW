		<![CDATA["Sandusky" was the term applied by Indians to the region and the villages on the site in the late 17th century.  In the 1730s there were Wyandot refugees living here in several villages.  Their leader was antagonistic to the French, so in 1745 he allowed the English to erect a post known as Fort Sandoski at his principal town on the Sandusky River.  The French reacted and he withdrew to Illinois country.  Following the French and Indian War, the victorious British began building forts in the Great Lakes region.  Fort Sandusky was rebuilt here in 1761 to connect the Sandusky Bay area, an important trade hub, to Fort Detroit and Fort Pitt in Pennsylvania.   In 1763, during Pontiac’s Rebellion, the Wyandots easily sacked and burned the lightly guarded fort.  Fort Sandusky was located near the Sandusky River and Lake Erie.

	<![CDATA[Fort Miami was built by the French in 1715 near Kekionga, a large Miami village at the convergence of the St. Joseph, St. Marys, and Maumee Rivers.  The French built the fort to protect the trade routes and to trade regularly with the Miami, who also were inclined to trade with the English, playing off the traders against each other for the best terms.  Fort Miami served as a French trading post until 1747, when the English-allied Hurons sacked and destroyed the fort.  Rebuilt by the British soon after, the fort was again destroyed in 1763 during Pontiac’s Rebellion.  Again rebuilt, Fort Miami became a successful trading post until the Revolutionary War.  The Americans built Ft. Wayne on this site.  This manuscript map of Fort Wayne (“Indiana Fort Wayne”) reportedly was made by P. M. Neff on July 18, 1795 for General Anthony Wayne.

However, by the 1700s, the area was inhabited primarily by the Potawatomis.  Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, a man of mixed African and European ancestry, founded the first trading post and married a Potawatomi woman in the 1770s.  Following the Treaty of Greenville in 1795, the area was ceded to the Americans, who built Fort Dearborn here in 1803.  "Chicago," drawn by Seth Eastman, in Henry R.

	<![CDATA[During their 1673 voyage, Marquette and Jolliet encountered Illinois Indians at their village, Kaskaskia.  In 1703, Kaskaskia became a Jesuit missionary post.  The settlement grew throughout the 1770s as the site became an important fur trade hub.  Fort de Chartres actually refers to three forts that were built by the French near the Mississippi River between 1720 and 1763.  The first Fort de Chartres was completed in 1720 and was intended to seat the Company of the Indies and the French government of the Illinois country and to control the Indians of the region (primarily the Fox).  Built close to the river, the fort saw deterioration due to flooding, and a second fort was built in 1725.  Like the first fort, this second one was built from logs and was similarly susceptible to deterioration, and by 1742 the French constructed a new fort built from limestone.  Throughout the 1700s, the French debated whether Kaskaskia or Fort de Chartres should be the primary trading post and fortification, and eventually the latter became the military post.  After 1763, the British renamed Fort de Chartres "Fort Cavendish," but found little use for it and, by the 1800s, the site had fallen into disrepair.  This photo shows the reconstructed fort.

	<![CDATA[Fort Detroit (or Fort Ponchartrain du Detroit) was established on the Detroit River in 1701 by French officer Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, who wanted to build trade alliances with local Indians.  Until 1760, when the British assumed control, the site was an important trading hub for Indian groups and Europeans.  Trade alliances deteriorated as a result of the harsh practices of the British.  During Pontiac’s Rebellion of 1763, Fort Detroit was one of the few forts not to fall to Pontiac’s forces.  In 1796, the Americans assumed control of Fort Detroit.  Painting, "A View of Detroit.

Located at the juncture of the Great Sauk Trail (an old trade route running east-west) and the Grand River Trail (a north-south route), this fort protected the fur trade against English incursions at the south end of Lake Michigan in later years.  In 1761, the British assumed control of the fort, and in 1763, during Pontiac’s Rebellion, the Potawatomi Indians captured it.  Later, the fort was an important trading post, eventually abandoned by the British in 1795.  Courtesy of the Fort St. Joseph Museum, Niles, Michigan]]>

	<![CDATA[Built by the French around 1715 along the southern shore of the Straits of Mackinac, Fort Michilimackinac was a key link in the French fur trading system. The French traded with the Native inhabitants, including Ottawa and Ojibwa, until 1761, when they relinquished the fort to the British.  The site remained an important trading post under the British.  In 1763, a group of Pontiac’s followers staged a game of lacrosse (or, baaga’adowe) as a ruse to enter the fort.  This attack was part of a larger front known as Pontiac’s Rebellion.  The Ojibwa held the fort for a year before the British retook and dismantled the wooden structure.  In 1781, the British built Fort Mackinac on nearby Mackinac Island. “Michilimackinack, 1836,” watercolor drawing by Seth Eastman, in Henry R.

In the early 1660s, French traders from Montreal established a base there and Jesuit missionaries founded a mission and called it Sault Ste. Marie in 1668.

From 1717 to 1760, the French operated a military post at La Baye, and in 1761 the British assumed control of the fort.  By this time, the settlement, now known as Baie Verte or Green Bay, was a thriving multiethnic trading community in which Métis played a central role.  By the mid-18th century, Green Bay was the third most lucrative trading post, behind Detroit and Michilimackinac.

Several Ojibwa villages were located throughout the area that was called Chequamegon and La Pointe.  The word Chequamegon is derived from an Ojibwa word for "at the sand bar."  As the French established trading posts here, they relied on the Ojibwa not only to obtain pelts, but also to bring in furs from the Dakota to the southwest.  In 1659, a post was built at Chequamegon.  In 1693, the French built a fort on Madeline Island, the largest island in Chequamegon Bay, and they called this site La Pointe.  The fort was abandoned by 1700, but was rebuilt in 1718.  Here the French traded and explored the copper mines in the region.  In 1759, the first English trader, Alexander Henry, established a post on the site.  In 1818, Lyman and Truman Warren came from Massachusetts to become the first American traders at Chequamegon and La Pointe.  Oil sketch, "Grant’s Point, Madeline Island," by David Geister.

In 1685, French explorer Nicolas Perrot established a trading post along the Mississippi River at Prairie du Chien.  After the emergence of the fur trade, Indians of the region viewed the site as neutral ground where many ethnic groups gathered to trade.  After the British defeated the French in 1763, the settlement became a multiethnic trading community in which Métis played a central role.  When the Americans defeated the British in 1816, Fort Crawford was constructed on the site and in 1825, 1829, and 1830 treaties were signed here by the United States and groups from the Sioux, Sauk, Fox, Menominee, Winnebago, and Ojibwa.

In 1686 French explorer Nicolas Perrot established Fort St. Antoine, the first European trading post of this region.  In 1699, Pierre-Charles Le Sueur traveled up the Mississippi to Lake Pepin and traded with bands of Dakota Indians that occupied the area.  The French built Fort Beauharnois in 1727 and then rebuilt the fort on higher ground in 1730.  In 1737, the Dakota attacked the fort, and the French burned it down before they fled.  In 1750, Fort la Jonquière was built on the site, but this fort too was abandoned when the French troops stationed there were sent east to fight the British in the French and Indian War.
