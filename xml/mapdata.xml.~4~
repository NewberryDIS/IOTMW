	<![CDATA[This quarry in southwest Minnesota is the site of an important source of pipestone.  Layers of mottled pink to brick red pipestone are sandwiched between layers of Sioux Quertzite rock covered by prairie plants and soil.  For at least 3,000 years Native Americans have quarried pipestone here.  In the 18th and early 19th centuries, the quarry was in Dakota territory but the Dakotas did not restrict access to the sacred quarry by other peoples.  The stone and pipes made from it have been found throughout the continent.  At the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux in 1851, the Dakota ceded their territory, including the pipestone quarry, but other Sioux tribes, including the Yankton, had rights there.  The Yankton (from South Dakota) signed a cession treaty in 1858, in which they retained a 650-acre reserve at the quarry. In 1937 the quarry area became the Pipestone National Monument, where Native Americans from federally recognized tribes, had the right to quarry.  The Upper Midwest Culture Center there offers programs for the public, including demonstrations by Native American carvers.  The Monument is on the National Register of Historic Places.

	<![CDATA[This lake and the surrounding forest are used by the Bois Forte Band of Ojibwa Indians. Covering 8,000 acres, the lake has wild rice beds that are the largest contiguous ones in the world.  About 100,000 pounds of wild rice are harvested in the fall by Native people using canoes and traditional methods.  Families use the rice for ceremonial purposes as well as for food, and some of the rice is sold.  The lake attracts game birds and animals.  Spirit Island sits in Nett Lake.  In Ojibwa belief, it got its name from the spirit being that has resided there since time immemorial and it has always been a sacred place.  Photo courtesy of Jeremy Wilburn ]]></caption>

Historically, the St. Marys rapids provided a spawning habitat for fish.  Eighty percent of the water that used to flow over the rapids is now diverted through a hydroelectric plant, and industrial and municipal pollution has impaired fisheries.  Efforts are underway to rehabilitate the habitat.  Photo courtesy of Super Cyclist]]></caption>

The Bay Mills Community successfully brought suit against the state to reaffirm their fishing rights based on the Treaty of 1836.  In 1985 the federal court assigned the northern half of the lake to Native fishermen, who fish in sheltered bays such as Grand Traverse Bay and Little Traverse Bay at the southern boundary of their treaty fishing waters.
