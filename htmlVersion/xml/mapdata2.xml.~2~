  <![CDATA[This group of Ojibwa signed the 1854 Treaty of La Pointe and, in return for land cession, obtained a reservation with the Bad River Band.  The Red Cliff Ojibwa were led by Chief Buffalo, who was allied with Catholic missionaries.  They split off from the Bad River Ojibwa, who were not Catholics.  In 1856, the President’s executive order created Red Cliff Reservation for them. They accepted an IRA tribal government. The reservation is 1 by 14 miles along the shore of Lake Superior.  The tribe owns over 7,000 acres.  There are about 5,500 members.  They have expended considerable resources on environmental protection and cultural programs.]]></caption>

	<![CDATA[These Ojibwas were living on the lake shore as early as 1745 and they resisted removal from Wisconsin.  In the winter of 1850-51, they and many other villages were forced to travel to Sandy Lake to get their treaty goods.  As a result, many died, and the public outcry led to their receiving a reservation at the time they ceded land in 1854 at the Treaty of La Pointe.  Allotment resulted in the stripping away of their timber resources and the loss of much of their land. Lac Courte Oreilles accepted an IRA government in 1966.  They have about 6,500 members, 60 percent of whom live in 23 different communities.  The tribe is the largest employer in Sawyer County.]]></caption>

They apparently were not at the La Pointe Treaty of 1854, and the other Ojibwa groups did not feel authorized to represent them, so they were not party to the treaty and did not receive a reservation.  At the time they accepted the Indian Reorganization Act, the United States recognized them as a tribe and assigned them a 1,700-acre reservation.  Their right to hunt and fish and harvest rice off the reservation also was acknowledged.  The Mole Lake reservation is 12 square miles, largely wilderness and encompassing Rice Lake, Mole Lake, and Bishop Lake.  They obtained more land in 1968 and now the tribe owns about 5,000 acres, some of it off the reservation.

Other Mohicans continued to sell land in New York and move west in the 1820s and beyond.  In 1836 they bought 44,000 acres from the Menominee and a reservation was established for them in 1856 on the southern end of the Menominee Reservation.  In 1871 the size of the reservation was reduced to 11,520 acres and it was allotted.  By 1934, they were largely landless but organized under the Indian Reorganization Act and acquired 3,400 acres.  By 1980, their land base had increased to almost 12,000 acres.  The tribe has about 1,700 members. ]]></caption>

In 1859 Congress recognized them as a tribe and agreed to their having a 9 square mile reservation. The Sioux Conflict of 1862 weakened their position, but by 1875 some had received homesteads scattered over 14 counties.  There were a few small settlements on tribal land near Black River Falls and 5 other places.  Still, they had an established presence in Wisconsin in the late 19th century.  By the 1930s, half of the land had been lost to taxes.  They did not organize a government under the Indian Reorganization Act in the 1930s, but succeeded in 1963.  In 1964 they adopted a constitution and started acquiring land at Black River Falls, Wisconsin Dells, Tomah, Wisconsin Rapids, and Wittenberg.  In 1994 they changed their official name to Ho-Chunk and the BIA recognized them as the Ho-Chunk Nation.  Today they have more than 6,800 acres in trust status, scattered through several counties.

This was resisted by most, but some bands did move to White Earth.  This reservation was allotted, that is, small parcels of land were assigned to individuals and the remainder opened to settlement.  In the early 20th century, through fraud most of the Indian-owned land was transferred to non-Indian ownership.  They organized under the IRA as a member of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe. In 1986 Congress acknowledged wrong-doing and awarded White Earth 10,000 acres and six million dollars in return for the theft of 100,000 acres.  The tribe used this money to start businesses.  Today, the reservation is about 850,000 acres; the tribe owns a little over 70,000 acres.  In fact, the land on the reservation is about 90 percent non-Indian owned.  There are over 20,000 members of the tribe, which contributes to a K-12 school and a tribal college.  Land recovery efforts are underway.]]></caption>

The outer circular design represents everything in nature (that is, the circle of life), as well as a shield (symbolic of the people’s historic struggle).  The four sections of the inner circle represent the four winds or directions: white (north), red (east), yellow (south), black (west).  The blue/green band between the circles stands for the Mide’wiwin or Medicine Society.  In the center of the arrowhead (which represents the 100-year war the Ojibwa fought with the Dakota and Fox) is a map of the reservation showing the three districts.  The four eagle feathers symbolize prayer and the two hair-ties are Mother Earth and Father Sky.  The reservation map is inserted in a figure eight.  This represents the “Eighth Fire” or the future for which the people are working.  Photo courtesy of Fond du Lac Band]]></img>

  <![CDATA[The Mille Lacs Band struggled historically to remain in their homeland because the policy of the federal government was to remove them to another Ojibwa reservation after they and other tribes ceded land in 1855.  In 1863, they persuaded the United States to allow them to remain in their homeland.  They organized under the IRA as members of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe. Today their reservation is about 60,000 acres on the shoreline of the lake and on three islands.  They have about 4,000 members, half of whom live on the reservation.  The tribe contributes millions of dollars to charity and gives major support to the local economy.  Among the tribal projects are a museum, two charter schools, an elders’ assisted living center, and a tribal college. ]]></caption>
