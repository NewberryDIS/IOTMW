<![CDATA[This was once a ceremonial center on the eastern edge of White River. Used for religious rituals from about 250 B.C. to A.D. 200, it was built on a high point near creeks and springs. There are several mounds and embankments or enclosures, including the Great Mound and Circular Earthworks, and the Circle Mound and Rectangular Earthworks. Circle Mound is shown here. It is contained within the Rectangular Earthworks, which had three enclosures. The Circle Mound (5 B.C.- A.D. 70) was oriented to the sunrise at the equinox, and the enclosure was aligned with the sunrise and sunset at the summer and winter solstice. This enclosure is 285 feet long, 225 feet wide, and 6 feet high, with a gateway at the east end. The embankment was constructed to allow people to view the rising and setting of the sun, moon, and brighter stars as well as the Pleiades Constellation. The mound is 148 feet long and 72 feet wide. The Great Mound is one of eight contained within the Circular Earthworks. This mound has a diameter of 350 feet. It was a natural mound around which a ditch 60 feet wide and 10 feet deep was constructed. Over time, people from different communities brought the remains of certain deceased persons (presumably leaders of family groups) to be reburied here. Pilgrims also came for other kinds of ceremonies, bringing offerings. There once were hundreds of sites of similar earthworks in Indiana that shared religious symbolism. This mound complex is located in Mounds State Park near Anderson. Photo courtesy of Archaeological Resources Management Service, Ball State University]]>
