The Red Cliff Ojibwa were led by Chief Buffalo, who was allied with Catholic missionaries.  They split off from the Bad River Ojibwa, who were not Catholics.  In 1856, the President’s executive order created Red Cliff Reservation for them. They accepted an IRA tribal government. The reservation is 1 by 14 miles along the shore of Lake Superior.  The tribe owns over 7,000 acres.  There are about 5,500 members.  They had expended considerable resources on environmental protection and cultural programs.]]></caption>

	<![CDATA[These Ojibwas were living on the lake shore as early as 1745 and they resisted removal from Wisconsin.  In the winter of 1850-51, they and many other villages were forced to travel to Sandy Lake to get their treaty goods.  As a result, many died, and the public outcry led to their receiving a reservation at the time they ceded land in 1854 at the Treaty of La Pointe.  Allotment resulted in the stripping away of their timber resources and the loss of much of their land. Lac Courte Oreilles accepted an IRA government.  They have about 6,500 members, 60 percent of whom live in 23 different communities.  The tribe is the largest employer in Sawyer County.]]></caption>

They apparently were not at the La Pointe Treaty of 1854, and the other Ojibwa groups did not feel authorized to represent them, so they were not party to the treaty and did not receive a reservation.  At the time they accepted the Indian Reorganization Act, the United States recognized them as a tribe and assigned them a 1,700-acre reservation.  Their right to hunt and fish and harvest rice off the reservation also was acknowledged.  The Mole Lake reservation is 12 square miles, largely wilderness and encompassing Rice Lake, Mole Lake, and Bishop Lake.

In 1859 Congress recognized them as a tribe and agreed to their having a 9 square mile reservation. The Sioux Conflict of 1862 weakened their position, but by 1875 some had received homesteads scattered over 14 counties.  There were a few small settlements on tribal land near Black River Falls and 5 other places.  Still, they had an established presence in Wisconsin in the late 19th century.  By the 1930s, half of the land had been lost to taxes.  They did not organize a government under the Indian Reorganization Act in the 1930s, but succeeded in 1963.  In 1964 they adopted a constitution and started acquiring land at Black River Falls, Wisconsin Dells, Tomah, Wisconsin Rapids, and Wittenberg.  In 1994 they changed their official name to Ho-Chunk and the BIA recognized them as the Ho-Chunk Nation.  Today they have more than 6,800 acres in trust status, scattered through several counties.

	<![CDATA[The Treaty of 1867 established a reservation for one band of Chippewa (Ojibwa) and subsequently the federal government tried to bring other bands there to consolidate the Ojibwa on one reservation.  This was resisted by most, but some bands did move to White Earth.  This reservation was allotted, that is, small parcels of land were assigned to individuals and the remainder opened to settlement.  In the early 20th century, through fraud most of the Indian-owned land was transferred to non-Indian ownership.  They organized under the IRA as a member of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe. In 1986 Congress acknowledged wrong-doing and awarded White Earth 10,000 acres and six million dollars in return for the theft of 100,000 acres.  The tribe used this money to start businesses.  Today, the reservation is about 850,000 acres; the tribe owns a little over 70,000 acres.  In fact, the land on the reservation is about 90 percent non-Indian owned.  There are over 20,000 members of the tribe, which contributes to a K-12 school and a tribal college.  Land recovery efforts are underway.]]></caption>

This large reservation contains almost 700,000 acres (212,000 acres actually are lakes).  But the federal government appropriated almost half as the National Chippewa Forest.  There are 40 wild rice producing lakes here, and the tribe is the largest employer in the county.  The tribe contributes to the tribal college and to a tribally-operated K-12 school.  About 9,000 people are enrolled at Leech Lake.]]></caption>

They could not pay the taxes on this land and lost it.  In 1999, they obtained recognition as a tribe through the BAR process.  Their community is named after the first chief to contact non-Indians in 1795.  The tribe has about 350 members.]]></caption>

This was resisted by most, but some bands did move to White Earth.  This reservation was allotted, that is, small parcels of land were assigned to individuals and the remainder opened to settlement.  In the early 20th century, through fraud most of the Indian-owned land was transferred to non-Indian ownership.  In 1986 Congress acknowledged wrong-doing as awarded White Earth 10,000 acres and six million dollars in return for the theft of 100,000 acres.  The tribe used this money to start businesses.  Today, the reservation is about 850,000 acres; the tribe owns a little over 70,000 acres.  In fact, the land on the reservation is about 90 percent non-Indian owned.  There are over 20,000 members of the tribe, which contributes to a K-12 school and a tribal college.  Land recovery efforts are underway.]]></caption>

   Two bands ceded land in 1855 in return for a reservation encompassing Leech Lake, which was expanded and consolidated in the area of three large lakes in 1864.  Boundaries were changed in the late 1860s and early 1870s.  This large reservation contains almost 700,000 acres (212,000 acres actually are lakes).  But the federal government appropriated almost half as the National Chippewa Forest.  There are 40 wild rice producing lakes here, and the tribe is the largest employer in the county.  The tribe contributes to the tribal college and to a tribally-operated K-12 school.  About 9,000 people are enrolled at Leech Lake.

By 1861, the Bay Mills land included almost 800 acres. After the reservation lands were allotted, most of the land was lost, but at the time of the Indian Reorganization Act and, later, in the 1970s, the community began to acquire land.  Today, the reservation is almost 4,000 square miles and includes Sugar Island, a few miles east in St. Marys River.  Bay Mills has about 1,700 members.  In 1984 the community opened the first tribally owned casino in the United States.  This income helps support environmental protection, an extensive program for elders, and a tribal college.  ]]></caption>

Other Mohicans continued to sell land in New York and move west in the 1820s and beyond.  In 1836 they bought 44,000 acres from the Menominee and a reservation was established for them in 1856 on the southern end of the Menominee Reservation.  In 1871 the size of the reservation was reduced to 11,520 acres and it was allotted.  By 1934, they were largely landless but organized under the Indian Reorganization Act and acquired 3,400 acres.  By 1980, their land base had increased to almost 12,000 acres.  The tribe has about 1,700 members.   ]]></caption>

In 1859 Congress recognized them as a tribe and agreed to their having a nine square mile reservation. The Sioux Conflict of 1862 weakened their position, but by 1875 some had received homesteads scattered over 14 counties.  There were a few small settlements on tribal land near Black River Falls and five other places.  Still, they had an established presence in Wisconsin in the late 19th century.  By the 1930s, half of the land had been lost to taxes.  They tried to organize under the Indian Reorganization Act, but federal officials rebuffed them.  They formed a government anyway and kept struggling.  In 1963 they obtained federal recognition, adopted a constitution, and started acquiring land at Black River Falls, Wisconsin Dells, Tomah, Wisconsin Rapids, and Wittenberg.  In 1994 they changed their official name to Ho-Chunk.  Today they have more than 6,800 acres in trust status, scattered through several counties.  The tribe has about 6,500 members.]]></caption>

This was resisted by most, but some bands did move to White Earth.  This reservation was allotted, that is, small parcels of land were assigned to individuals and the remainder opened to settlement.  In the early 20th century, through fraud most of the Indian-owned land was transferred to non-Indian ownership.  In 1986 Congress acknowledged wrong-doing and awarded White Earth 10,000 acres and six million dollars as compensation for the loss of 100,000 acres.  The tribe used this money to start businesses.  Today, the reservation is about 850,000 acres; the tribe owns a little over 70,000 acres.  In fact, the land on the reservation is about 90 percent non-Indian owned.  There are over 20,000 members of the tribe, which contributes to a K-12 school and a tribal college.  Land recovery efforts are underway.]]></caption>

In 1961 Congress “terminated” the tribe and the reservation became Menominee County, with the land in fee status.  Land subsequently was lost, but Congress restored the Menominee as a federally recognized tribe in 1973 and the reservation status of their land was reestablished.  The Menominee have used much of their business income to buy back land.  Now they have 230,000 acres, mostly owned by the tribe.  The Menominee Tribe has about 8,400 members.]]></caption>

Other Mohicans continued to sell land in New York and move west in the 1820s and beyond.  In 1836 they bought 44,000 acres from the Menominee and a reservation was established for them in 1856 on the southern end of the Menominee Reservation.  In 1871 the size of the reservation was reduced to 11,520 acres and it was allotted.  By 1934, they were largely landless but organized under the Indian Reorganization Act and acquired 3,400 acres.

In 1859 Congress recognized them as a tribe and agreed to their having a nine square mile reservation. The Sioux Conflict of 1862 weakened their position, but by 1875 some had received homesteads scattered over 14 counties.  There were a few small settlements on tribal land near Black River Falls and five other places.  Still, they had an established presence in Wisconsin in the late 19th century.  By the 1930s, half of the land had been lost to taxes.  They tried to organize under the Indian Reorganization Act, but federal officials rebuffed them.  They formed a government anyway and kept struggling.  In 1963 they obtained federal recognition, adopted a constitution, and started acquiring land at Black River Falls, Wisconsin Dells, Tomah, Wisconsin Rapids, and Wittenberg.  In 1994 they changed their official name to Ho-Chunk.  Today they have more than 6,800 acres in trust status, scattered through several counties.  The tribe has about 6,500 members.]]></caption>

This was resisted by most, but some bands did move to White Earth.  This reservation was allotted, that is, small parcels of land were assigned to individuals and the remainder opened to settlement.  In the early 20th century, through fraud most of the Indian-owned land was transferred to non-Indian ownership.  In 1986 Congress acknowledged wrong-doing and awarded White Earth 10,000 acres and six million dollars as compensation for the loss of 100,000 acres.  The tribe used this money to start businesses.  Today, the reservation is about 850,000 acres; the tribe owns a little over 70,000 acres.  In fact, the land on the reservation is about 90 percent non-Indian owned.  There are over 20,000 members of the tribe, which contributes to a K-12 school and a tribal college.  Land recovery efforts are underway.]]></caption>

Members of Chief Red Wing’s band of Mdewakanton Dakota ceded land in 1851 in return for a small reservation in their homeland.  Most Dakota were removed from Minnesota after the Sioux Uprising in 1862 but in 1886 a small group living on Prairie Island was recognized by the federal government and their reservation was reestablished there.  They obtained more land in the 1930s, but shortly afterwards their land was flooded by a dam.  In 2006 the federal government added 1,290 acres to their 2,500-acre reservation in compensation for the flooding.  Tribal acreage is noncontiguous. The tribe has about 750 members, half of whom live on the reservation.  Today, the tribe is the largest employer in the county.]]></caption>

Giiwegiizhigookway Martin, in consultation with her mother Rose Polar Martin, created the design.  The four sections represent the four seasons, and the four colors in each section represent the four directions.  The four original clans are symbolized by the eagle, bear, turtle, and fish.  Floral designs represent the artistic heritage of the Ojibwas, and the wild rice in the lower right quadrant shows the importance of traditional subsistence in Ojibwa life today.  The drum design in the center represents the life force, and the community’s term for their reservation in the native language is written there: “Old Planting Ground” (the original homeland).

Other Mohicans continued to sell land in New York and move west in the 1820s and beyond.

In 1859 Congress recognized them as a tribe and agreed to their having a nine square mile reservation. The Sioux Conflict of 1862 weakened their position, but by 1875 some had received homesteads scattered over 14 counties.  There were a few small settlements on tribal land near Black River Falls and five other places.  Still, they had an established presence in Wisconsin in the late 19th century.  By the 1930s, half of the land had been lost to taxes.  They tried to organize under the Indian Reorganization Act, but federal officials rebuffed them.  They formed a government anyway and kept struggling.  In 1963 they obtained federal recognition, adopted a constitution, and started acquiring land at Black River Falls, Wisconsin Dells, Tomah, Wisconsin Rapids, and Wittenberg.  In 1994 they changed their official name to Ho-Chunk.  Today they have more than 6,800 acres in trust status, scattered through several counties.  The tribe has about 6,500 members.]]></caption>

This was resisted by most, but some bands did move to White Earth.  This reservation was allotted, that is, small parcels of land were assigned to individuals and the remainder opened to settlement.  In the early 20th century, through fraud most of the Indian-owned land was transferred to non-Indian ownership.  In 1986 Congress acknowledged wrong-doing and awarded White Earth 10,000 acres and six million dollars as compensation for the loss of 100,000 acres.  The tribe used this money to start businesses.  Today, the reservation is about 850,000 acres; the tribe owns a little over 70,000 acres.  In fact, the land on the reservation is about 90 percent non-Indian owned.  There are over 20,000 members of the tribe, which contributes to a K-12 school and a tribal college.  Land recovery efforts are underway.]]></caption>

Allotment resulted in the stripping away of their timber resources and the loss of much of their land.  They have about 24,000 acres and 6,500 members, 60 percent of whom live in 23 different communities.  The tribe is the largest employer in Sawyer County.]]></caption>

They apparently were not at the La Pointe Treaty of 1854, and the other Ojibwa groups did not feel authorized to represent them, so they were not party to the treaty and did not receive a reservation.  At the time they accepted the Indian Reorganization Act, the United States recognized them as a tribe and assigned them a 1,700-acre reservation.  Their right to hunt and fish and harvest rice off the reservation also was acknowledged.  The Mole Lake reservation is 12 square miles, largely wilderness and encompassing Rice Lake, Mole Lake, and Bishop Lake.  They obtained more land in 1968 and now the tribe owns about 5,000 acres, some of it off the reservation.

The Sioux Conflict of 1862 weakened their position, but by 1875 some had received homesteads scattered over 14 counties.  There were a few small settlements on tribal land near Black River Falls and five other places.  Still, they had an established presence in Wisconsin in the late 19th century.  By the 1930s, half of the land had been lost to taxes.  They tried to organize under the Indian Reorganization Act, but federal officials rebuffed them.  They formed a government anyway and kept struggling.  In 1963 they obtained federal recognition, adopted a constitution, and started acquiring land at Black River Falls, Wisconsin Dells, Tomah, Wisconsin Rapids, and Wittenberg.  In 1994 they changed their official name to Ho-Chunk.  Today they have more than 6,800 acres in trust status, scattered through several counties.  The tribe has about 6,500 members.]]></caption>

This was resisted by most, but some bands did move to White Earth.  This reservation was allotted, that is, small parcels of land were assigned to individuals and the remainder opened to settlement.  In the early 20th century, through fraud most of the Indian-owned land was transferred to non-Indian ownership.  In 1986 Congress acknowledged wrong-doing and awarded White Earth 10,000 acres and six million dollars as compensation for the loss of 100,000 acres.  The tribe used this money to start businesses.  Today, the reservation is about 850,000 acres; the tribe owns a little over 70,000 acres.  In fact, the land on the reservation is about 90 percent non-Indian owned.  There are over 20,000 members of the tribe, which contributes to a K-12 school and a tribal college.  Land recovery efforts are underway.]]></caption>

The four sections of the inner circle represent the four winds or directions: white (north), red (east), yellow (south), black (west).  The blue/green band between the circles stands for the Mide’wiwin or Medicine Society.  In the center of the arrowhead (which represents the 100-year war the Ojibwa fought with the Dakota and Fox) is a map of the reservation showing the three districts.

In the winter of 1850-51, they and many other villages were forced to travel to Sandy Lake to get their treaty goods.  As a result, many died, and the public outcry led to their receiving a reservation at the time they ceded land in 1854 at the Treaty of La Pointe.  Allotment resulted in the stripping away of their timber resources and the loss of much of their land.

The Sioux Conflict of 1862 weakened their position, but by 1875 some had received homesteads scattered over 14 counties.  There were a few small settlements on tribal land near Black River Falls and five other places.  Still, they had an established presence in Wisconsin in the late 19th century.  By the 1930s, half of the land had been lost to taxes.  They tried to organize under the Indian Reorganization Act, but federal officials rebuffed them.  They formed a government anyway and kept struggling.  In 1963 they obtained federal recognition, adopted a constitution, and started acquiring land at Black River Falls, Wisconsin Dells, Tomah, Wisconsin Rapids, and Wittenberg.  In 1994 they changed their official name to Ho-Chunk.  Today they have more than 6,800 acres in trust status, scattered through several counties.  The tribe has about 6,500 members.]]></caption>

This was resisted by most, but some bands did move to White Earth.  This reservation was allotted, that is, small parcels of land were assigned to individuals and the remainder opened to settlement.  In the early 20th century, through fraud most of the Indian-owned land was transferred to non-Indian ownership.  In 1986 Congress acknowledged wrong-doing and awarded White Earth 10,000 acres and six million dollars as compensation for the loss of 100,000 acres.  The tribe used this money to start businesses.  Today, the reservation is about 850,000 acres; the tribe owns a little over 70,000 acres.  In fact, the land on the reservation is about 90 percent non-Indian owned.  There are over 20,000 members of the tribe, which contributes to a K-12 school and a tribal college.  Land recovery efforts are underway.]]></caption>

The nine feathers symbolize the nine bands and their chiefs, who signed the 1855 Treaty of Detroit.  The members of the band descend from these people and the seal honors them.  The four-color band signifies four directions, four seasons, four stages of life, and the four “races” (because the community is “multi-racial”).

The Sioux Conflict of 1862 weakened their position, but by 1875 some had received homesteads scattered over 14 counties.  There were a few small settlements on tribal land near Black River Falls and five other places.  Still, they had an established presence in Wisconsin in the late 19th century.  By the 1930s, half of the land had been lost to taxes.  They tried to organize under the Indian Reorganization Act, but federal officials rebuffed them.  They formed a government anyway and kept struggling.  In 1963 they obtained federal recognition, adopted a constitution, and started acquiring land at Black River Falls, Wisconsin Dells, Tomah, Wisconsin Rapids, and Wittenberg.  In 1994 they changed their official name to Ho-Chunk.  Today they have more than 6,800 acres in trust status, scattered through several counties.  The tribe has about 6,500 members.]]></caption>

	<![CDATA[The Treaty of 1867 established a reservation for one band of Ojibwa and subsequently the federal government tried to bring other bands there to consolidate the Ojibwa on one reservation.  This was resisted by most, but some bands did move to White Earth.  This reservation was allotted, that is, small parcels of land were assigned to individuals and the remainder opened to settlement.  In the early 20th century, through fraud most of the Indian-owned land was transferred to non-Indian ownership.  In 1986 Congress acknowledged wrong-doing and awarded White Earth 10,000 acres and six million dollars as compensation for the loss of 100,000 acres.  The tribe used this money to start businesses.  Today, the reservation is about 850,000 acres; the tribe owns a little over 70,000 acres.  In fact, the land on the reservation is about 90 percent non-Indian owned.  There are over 20,000 members of the tribe, which contributes to a K-12 school and a tribal college.  Land recovery efforts are underway.]]></caption>

The reservation was later expanded to include three other large lakes.  Boundaries were changed in the late 1860s and early 1870s.  This large reservation contains almost 700,000 acres (212,000 acres actually are lakes).  But the federal government appropriated almost half as the National Chippewa Forest.  There are 40 wild rice producing lakes here, and the tribe is the largest employer in the county.  The tribe contributes to the tribal college and to a tribally-operated K-12 school.  About 9,000 people are enrolled at Leech Lake.

By 1861, the Bay Mills land included almost 800 acres. After the reservation lands were allotted, most of the land was lost, but at the time of the Indian Reorganization Act and, later, in the 1970s, the community began to acquire land.  Today, the reservation is almost 4,000 square miles and includes Sugar Island, a few miles east in St. Marys River.  Bay Mills has about 1,700 members.  In 1984 the community opened the first tribally owned casino in the United States.  This income helps support environmental protection, an extensive program for elders, and a tribal college.  ]]></caption>

	<![CDATA[In 1837 the Ho-Chunk (at the time, Winnebago) were forced to cede their land in Wisconsin, although many remained after the “treaty Winnebago” moved to Minnesota.  In 1859 Congress recognized them as a tribe and agreed to their having a nine square mile reservation. The Sioux Conflict of 1862 weakened their position, but by 1875 some had received homesteads scattered over 14 counties.  There were a few small settlements on tribal land near Black River Falls and five other places.  Still, they had an established presence in Wisconsin in the late 19th century.  By the 1930s, half of the land had been lost to taxes.  They tried to organize under the Indian Reorganization Act, but federal officials rebuffed them.  They formed a government anyway and kept struggling.  In 1963 they obtained federal recognition, adopted a constitution, and started acquiring land at Black River Falls, Wisconsin Dells, Tomah, Wisconsin Rapids, and Wittenberg.  In 1994 they changed their official name to Ho-Chunk.  Today they have more than 6,800 acres in trust status, scattered through several counties.  The tribe has about 6,500 members.]]></caption>

	<![CDATA[The Treaty of 1867 established a reservation for one band of Ojibwa and subsequently the federal government tried to bring other bands there to consolidate the Ojibwa on one reservation.  This was resisted by most, but some bands did move to White Earth.  This reservation was allotted, that is, small parcels of land were assigned to individuals and the remainder opened to settlement.  In the early 20th century, through fraud most of the Indian-owned land was transferred to non-Indian ownership.  In 1986 Congress acknowledged wrong-doing and awarded White Earth 10,000 acres and six million dollars as compensation for the loss of 100,000 acres.  The tribe used this money to start businesses.  Today, the reservation is about 850,000 acres; the tribe owns a little over 70,000 acres.  In fact, the land on the reservation is about 90 percent non-Indian owned.  There are over 20,000 members of the tribe, which contributes to a K-12 school and a tribal college.  Land recovery efforts are underway.]]></caption>

The reservation was later expanded to include three other large lakes.  Boundaries were changed in the late 1860s and early 1870s.  This large reservation contains almost 700,000 acres (212,000 acres actually are lakes).  But the federal government appropriated almost half as the National Chippewa Forest.  There are 40 wild rice producing lakes here, and the tribe is the largest employer in the county.  The tribe contributes to the tribal college and to a tribally-operated K-12 school.

  <caption name="Miami Nation, Peru" src="Miami-Headquarters.jpg" state="Indiana" color="0xff0000" url="" ><![CDATA[They sent a letter of intent to petition in 1980, a documented petition in 1984, but were denied federal recognition in 1992.  Their history is as follows.  A group of Miami families remained in Indiana after the removal period in the 1840s.  They continually sought federal recognition as a tribe entitled to certain rights, and they had a succession of chiefs who pursued these goals.  In the 1870s they had successfully petitioned the secretary of the interior to allot their reservation and put the allotments in trust status (not taxable) until 1881.  They had federal recognition but no Indian agent. In the 1890s, they began to pursue filing a legal claim against the U.S. for treaty violations.  In the 1920s they were still working on claims and organized as the Miami Nation of Indians of Indiana.  The clan system still was central to tribal government.  They unsuccessfully sought to obtain reorganization under the Indian Reorganization Act in the 1930s.  In 1937 they got a state charter for their organization and in 1969 received a monetary award in one of their claims cases.  They continued to work on claims into the 1970s.  Organized as the Miami Nation in 1964, leaders continued to push for federal recognition.  In the 1970s, they had several gatherings, a tribal council (since 1903) representing the family groups, and various cultural and political activities.
	In 1979 the Miami Nation met and decided to petition the BAR for federal recognition.  In July 1984 (after much work and expense), they submitted their petition.  The next year the BAR responded generally positively but requested more documentation on two of the seven criteria.  After receiving more information, in 1990 the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs rejected the petition, maintaining that the Miami did not adequately prove that they had a tribal government since World War II or a contemporary tribal community.  That same year the BIA approved the 4,387-member Miami tribal roll for the purposes of paying a claim. In fact, the Miamis believed that smaller tribes with similar histories had been recognized because they would be less of a financial burden on the government than a tribe of over 4,000. The Miami appealed the decision but in 1992 the appeal was denied.  In 1991 they had begun working with Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana to obtain Congressional recognition.  At first, they had his support, but fears of gaming activity that would undermine the state lottery eventually killed the legislation.  So in 1992 the Miami filed suit in federal court in Indiana but were not successful.  The Miami Nation has purchased land and continues cultural and political activities. They are attempting to gain recognition from the state of Indiana. ]]></caption>

  <caption name="Brothertown Indian Nation, Fond du Lac" src="Samson-Occom.jpg" state="Wisconsin" color="0xff0000" url="" ><![CDATA[The Brothertown Indians are descendants of seven Christian Indian towns in Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Long Island, New York.  These people were an amalgamation of New England and Long Island Indians (including Mohegans and Pequots) who had converted to Christianity during the 1740s.  Poverty-stricken, they obtained the permission of the Oneidas to settle on and farm some Oneida land in New York, and moved there in 1775.  The Revolutionary War forced them to flee to Massachusetts, where they joined the Stockbridge Indians.  By 1785 they were back in New York in their town called Brothertown, named by Samson Occom, schoolmaster and Presbyterian minister.  In the early 1800s settlers forced them out.  They decided to migrate to Wisconsin, and delegates (along with Stockbridge and Oneida delegates) traveled to Green Bay in 1821 and 1823 to negotiate with Menominees and Ho-Chunks for some land.  It was not until 1831 and 1832 that treaties were signed that assigned them land—23,000 acres along the eastern shore of Lake Winnebago.  The first Brothertowns arrived at the Wisconsin settlement in 1831, where they owned the land communally.
	At this time, the federal government was trying to remove Indians from east of the Mississippi.  The Brothertown community became alarmed and decided to secure title to their land so as not to be subject to federal trusteeship, which would make them vulnerable to federal dictates.  Their leaders asked Congress to allot their land to individuals and grant them U. S. citizenship.  In 1839 they became citizens, but did not request dissolution of their tribe.  But at this time dual citizenship was not possible, so the federal government no longer regarded Brothertown a sovereign nation.  Individual land owners could sell their allotments, so land was lost throughout subsequent years.  During the late 19th century, leaders continued to negotiate with the federal government, pressing the tribe’s legal claims arising from the treaty of 1831.  In the 1920s and 1930s they joined with the Oneida and Stockbridge in a land claim suit involving the New York lands.  In 1950 Brothertown filed suit with the Indian Claims Commission and won a judgment award.  At this time they updated their tribal roll.
	In 1980 the Brothertown community sent a letter of intent to the BAR to petition for federal recognition.  But BAR criteria disqualify tribes that lost federal recognition through Congressional legislation, so they have not obtained recognition.  The Brothertown roll has about 3,000 members.  Most live near Fond du Lac and Lake Winnebago.  They have an elected tribal council and are trying to establish a land base. ]]></caption>

In 1836 they bought 44,000 acres from the Menominee and a reservation was established for them in 1856 on the southern end of the Menominee Reservation.  In 1871 the size of the reservation was reduced to 11,520 acres and it was allotted.  By 1934, they were largely landless but organized under the Indian Reorganization Act and acquired 3,400 acres.  By 1980, their land base had increased to almost 12,000 acres.  The tribe has about 1,700 members.   ]]></caption>

	<![CDATA[In 1837 the Ho-Chunk (at the time, Winnebago) were forced to cede their land in Wisconsin, although many remained after the “treaty Winnebago” moved to Minnesota.  In 1859 Congress recognized them as a tribe and agreed to their having a nine square mile reservation. The Sioux Conflict of 1862 weakened their position, but by 1875 some had received homesteads scattered over 14 counties.  There were a few small settlements on tribal land near Black River Falls and five other places.  Still, they had an established presence in Wisconsin in the late 19th century.  By the 1930s, half of the land had been lost to taxes.  They tried to organize under the Indian Reorganization Act, but federal officials rebuffed them.  They formed a government anyway and kept struggling.  In 1963 they obtained federal recognition, adopted a constitution, and started acquiring land at Black River Falls, Wisconsin Dells, Tomah, Wisconsin Rapids, and Wittenberg.  In 1994 they changed their official name to Ho-Chunk.  Today they have more than 6,800 acres in trust status, scattered through several counties.  The tribe has about 6,500 members.]]></caption>

	<![CDATA[The Treaty of 1867 established a reservation for one band of Ojibwa and subsequently the federal government tried to bring other bands there to consolidate the Ojibwa on one reservation.  This was resisted by most, but some bands did move to White Earth.  This reservation was allotted, that is, small parcels of land were assigned to individuals and the remainder opened to settlement.  In the early 20th century, through fraud most of the Indian-owned land was transferred to non-Indian ownership.  In 1986 Congress acknowledged wrong-doing and awarded White Earth 10,000 acres and six million dollars as compensation for the loss of 100,000 acres.  The tribe used this money to start businesses.  Today, the reservation is about 850,000 acres; the tribe owns a little over 70,000 acres.  In fact, the land on the reservation is about 90 percent non-Indian owned.  There are over 20,000 members of the tribe, which contributes to a K-12 school and a tribal college.  Land recovery efforts are underway.]]></caption>

The reservation was later expanded to include three other large lakes.  Boundaries were changed in the late 1860s and early 1870s.  This large reservation contains almost 700,000 acres (212,000 acres actually are lakes).  But the federal government appropriated almost half as the National Chippewa Forest.  There are 40 wild rice producing lakes here, and the tribe is the largest employer in the county.  The tribe contributes to the tribal college and to a tribally-operated K-12 school.  About 9,000 people are enrolled at Leech Lake.

	<![CDATA[The Treaty of 1867 established a reservation for one band of Chippewa (Ojibwa) and subsequently the federal government tried to bring other bands there to consolidate the Ojibwa on one reservation.  This was resisted by most, but some bands did move to White Earth.  This reservation was allotted, that is, small parcels of land were assigned to individuals and the remainder opened to settlement.  In the early 20th century, through fraud most of the Indian-owned land was transferred to non-Indian ownership.  They organized under the IRA as a member of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe. In 1986 Congress acknowledged wrong-doing and awarded White Earth 10,000 acres and six million dollars in return for the theft of 100,000 acres.  The tribe used this money to start businesses.  Today, the reservation is about 850,000 acres; the tribe owns a little over 70,000 acres.  In fact, the land on the reservation is about 90 percent non-Indian owned.  There are over 20,000 members of the tribe, which contributes to a K-12 school and a tribal college.  Land recovery efforts are underway.]]></caption>

Today, the reservation is almost 4,000 square miles and includes Sugar Island, a few miles east in St. Marys River.  Bay Mills has about 1,700 members. Income from the tribe’s casino helps support environmental protection, an extensive program for elders, and a tribal college.]]></caption>

  <caption name="Burt Lake Ottawa and Chippewa" src="Burt_Lake_Band.jpg" state="Michigan" color="0xff0000" url="" ><![CDATA[The Burt Lake Ottawa and Chippewa (the Cheboygan Band) signed the Treaty of 1836, in which the U.S. guaranteed them a reservation in their homeland in the Burt Lake area for five years.  The U.S. reneged on this promise.  This village or band next signed the 1855 Treaty of Detroit, which provided for individual allotments on reservations, and in 1872 Congress assigned the Cheboygans allotments on two townships.  Looking for more security, the Burt Lake Ottawa and Chippewa used their treaty annuity payments to purchase land in Cheboygan County, and the state of Michigan and the federal government agreed that the land would not be taxed.  But the Burt Lake Indians now were citizens and taxes were assessed.  In 1900, John McGinn, a non-Indian speculator bought the land for back taxes and, when the Indian men were away working, drove the women and children out of their village and burned it to the ground.  The Burt Lake Indians then resided with other nearby Indians.  The U.S. filed suit against McGinn in 1911 seeking to regain the land for the Cheboygan tribe.  The Michigan court decided against the U.S. and, despite entreaties by Burt Lake leaders over the next 20 years, the U.S. did not appeal.  Throughout these years they remained a hardworking, cooperating community that had leaders and held gatherings and ceremonies as well as maintained their own Catholic church and cemetery.
	In 1934 the Cheboygans asked to be politically organized under the Indian Reorganization Act but the BIA rejected the appeal because the Burt Lake Indians did not have a land base.  In 1985 they sent a letter of intent to petition for recognition to the BAR.  In 2005 they petitioned the Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs for federal recognition but were denied in 2006, apparently because some of their members had enrolled in another tribe in order to obtain services from the federal government.  In 2007 Congress also denied their request for recognition.  The 650-member community has a tribal office in Brutus, Michigan. ]]></caption>

	<![CDATA[The Swan Creek and Black River villages (or bands) lived in southeast Michigan when they ceded this homeland in treaties in 1807 and 1836.  But many remained in the area.  In 1855 they and the Saginaw band signed a treaty with the U.S.  In 1864 they all signed another treaty in order to obtain a reservation, but most of the Swan Creek and Black River Ojibwa lived off the reservation in their homeland in southeast Michigan.  During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, they worked and lived in their homeland, maintaining a network of cooperating kin, supported their own Indian church and cemetery, and had gatherings.  Their leaders tried to represent their interests in dealings with federal officials.
	In 1934 when the Indian Reorganization Act was proposed, the Swan Creek Black River Ojibwa wanted a tribal government separate from the Saginaws, but this idea was rejected.  Most Swan Creek Black River Ojibwa still lived off the Isabella reservation.  In the 1980s, some enrolled with the Saginaw in order to share in the payments from a treaty claim.
	In December 1991 these people incorporated as the Swan Creek Black River Confederated Ojibwa Tribe, and in February 1992 the state of Michigan recognized them as an Indian tribe.  The next year they submitted a letter of intent to the BAR, petitioning for federal recognition.  In 1998 they brought their case to Congress but did not succeed.  They continue to have meetings and maintain a roll but do not have an official headquarters. ]]></caption>

The 1855 treaty provided for the removal of Ottawas north of the Grand River, but apparently some stayed behind.  In 1934 they requested to form a tribal government under the Indian Reorganization Act, but the BIA, while agreeing they were eligible, denied them reorganization due to funding issues.  In the 1940s they organized with other Ottawa tribes as the Northern Michigan Ottawa Association to pursue treaty claims.  The Indian Claims Commission decided in their favor.  In 1976 Congress provided some of the judgment funds to the Grand River Ottawa, to descendants of people on the 1908 roll who had ¼ blood quantum.  In 1997 Congress provided for the distribution of more of the judgment funds to Ottawa tribes, including unrecognized ones that could obtain recognition by 2006.  The Grand River Ottawa, despite their belief that they were already federally recognized, began the recognition process.
	In 1994 the Grand River Bands of Ottawa Indians sent a letter of intent to the BAR.  In 2000 they submitted a documented petition.  They received a reply in 2005 and sent additional documentation in 2006.  Worried that the BAR would delay acting on the petition, the tribe unsuccessfully petitioned Congress to instruct the BAR to act by a certain time so that they could meet Congress’s deadline to qualify for judgment funds.  The Grand River Ottawa have 700 members, still living in southwest Michigan, and they have official leaders and ceremonies in the Grand River area, as well as an organization that tries to provide services. ]]></caption>

Their leader was antagonistic to the French, so in 1745 he allowed the English to erect a post known as Fort Sandoski at his principal town on the Sandusky River.  The French reacted and he withdrew to Illinois country.  Following the French and Indian War, the victorious British began building forts in the Great Lakes region.  Fort Sandusky was rebuilt here in 1761 to connect the Sandusky Bay area, an important trade hub, to Fort Detroit and Fort Pitt in Pennsylvania.   In 1763, during Pontiac’s Rebellion, the Wyandots easily sacked and burned the lightly guarded fort.  Fort Sandusky was located near the Sandusky River and Lake Erie.

The French built the fort to protect the trade routes and to trade regularly with the Miami, who also were inclined to trade with the English, playing off the traders against each other for the best terms.  Fort Miami served as a French trading post until 1747, when the English-allied Hurons sacked and destroyed the fort.  Rebuilt by the British soon after, the fort was again destroyed in 1763 during Pontiac’s Rebellion.  Again rebuilt, Fort Miami became a successful trading post until the Revolutionary War.  The Americans built Ft. Wayne on this site.  This manuscript map of Fort Wayne (“Indiana Fort Wayne”) reportedly was made by P. M. Neff on July 18, 1795 for General Anthony Wayne.

	<![CDATA[During their 1673 voyage, Marquette and Jolliet encountered Illinois Indians at their village, Kaskaskia.  In 1703, Kaskaskia became a Jesuit missionary post.  The settlement grew throughout the 1770s as the site became an important fur trade hub.  Fort de Chartres actually refers to three forts that were built by the French near the Mississippi River between 1720 and 1763.  The first Fort de Chartres was completed in 1720 and was intended to seat the Company of the Indies and the French government of the Illinois country and to control the Indians of the region (primarily the Fox).  Built close to the river, the fort saw deterioration due to flooding, and a second fort was built in 1725.  Like the first fort, this second one was built from logs and was similarly susceptible to deterioration, and by 1742 the French constructed a new fort built from limestone.  Throughout the 1700s, the French debated whether Kaskaskia or Fort de Chartres should be the primary trading post and fortification, and eventually the latter became the military post.  After 1763, the British renamed Fort de Chartres "Fort Cavendish," but found little use for it and, by the 1800s, the site had fallen into disrepair.  This photo shows the reconstructed fort.

The site remained an important trading post under the British.  In 1763, a group of Pontiac’s followers staged a game of lacrosse (or, baaga’adowe) as a ruse to enter the fort.  This attack was part of a larger front known as Pontiac’s Rebellion.  The Ojibwa held the fort for a year before the British retook and dismantled the wooden structure.  In 1781, the British built Fort Mackinac on nearby Mackinac Island. “Michilimackinack, 1836,” watercolor drawing by Seth Eastman, in Henry R.

As the French established trading posts here, they relied on the Ojibwa not only to obtain pelts, but also to bring in furs from the Dakota to the southwest.  In 1659, a post was built at Chequamegon.  In 1693, the French built a fort on Madeline Island, the largest island in Chequamegon Bay, and they called this site La Pointe.  The fort was abandoned by 1700, but was rebuilt in 1718.  Here the French traded and explored the copper mines in the region.

In 1685, French explorer Nicolas Perrot established a trading post along the Mississippi River at Prairie du Chien.  After the emergence of the fur trade, Indians of the region viewed the site as neutral ground where many ethnic groups gathered to trade.  After the British defeated the French in 1763, the settlement became a multiethnic trading community in which Métis played a central role.  When the Americans defeated the British in 1816, Fort Crawford was constructed on the site and in 1825, 1829, and 1830 treaties were signed here by the United States and groups from the Sioux, Sauk, Fox, Menominee, Winnebago, and Ojibwa.

		<![CDATA[The Lake Pepin area, a wide section of the Mississippi River, has a varied history of trading and French-Indian interaction.  In 1686 French explorer Nicolas Perrot established Fort St. Antoine, the first European trading post of this region.  In 1699, Pierre-Charles Le Sueur traveled up the Mississippi to Lake Pepin and traded with bands of Dakota Indians that occupied the area.  The French built Fort Beauharnois in 1727 and then rebuilt the fort on higher ground in 1730.  In 1737, the Dakota attacked the fort, and the French burned it down before they fled.  In 1750, Fort la Jonquière was built on the site, but this fort too was abandoned when the French troops stationed there were sent east to fight the British in the French and Indian War.

		<![CDATA["Sandusky" was the term applied by Indians to the region and the villages on the site in the late 17th century.  In the 1730s there were Wyandot refugees living here in several villages.  Their leader was antagonistic to the French, so in 1745 he allowed the English to erect a post known as Fort Sandoski at his principal town on the Sandusky River.  The French reacted and he withdrew to Illinois country.  Following the French and Indian War, the victorious British began building forts in the Great Lakes region.  Fort Sandusky was rebuilt here in 1761 to connect the Sandusky Bay area, an important trade hub, to Fort Detroit and Fort Pitt in Pennsylvania.   In 1763, during Pontiac’s Rebellion, the Wyandots easily sacked and burned the lightly guarded fort.  Fort Sandusky was located near the Sandusky River and Lake Erie.

The French built the fort to protect the trade routes and to trade regularly with the Miami, who also were inclined to trade with the English, playing off the traders against each other for the best terms.  Fort Miami served as a French trading post until 1747, when the English-allied Hurons sacked and destroyed the fort.  Rebuilt by the British soon after, the fort was again destroyed in 1763 during Pontiac’s Rebellion.  Again rebuilt, Fort Miami became a successful trading post until the Revolutionary War.  The Americans built Ft. Wayne on this site.  This manuscript map of Fort Wayne (“Indiana Fort Wayne”) reportedly was made by P. M. Neff on July 18, 1795 for General Anthony Wayne.

Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, a man of mixed African and European ancestry, founded the first trading post and married a Potawatomi woman in the 1770s.

	<caption name="Fort de Chartres, Illinois" state="Illinois" src="53Fort-de-Chartres-reconst.jpg" lat="38.0500" lng="-90.1500" type="post">
	<![CDATA[During their 1673 voyage, Marquette and Jolliet encountered Illinois Indians at their village, Kaskaskia.  In 1703, Kaskaskia became a Jesuit missionary post.  The settlement grew throughout the 1770s as the site became an important fur trade hub.  Fort de Chartres actually refers to three forts that were built by the French near the Mississippi River between 1720 and 1763.  The first Fort de Chartres was completed in 1720 and was intended to seat the Company of the Indies and the French government of the Illinois country and to control the Indians of the region (primarily the Fox).  Built close to the river, the fort saw deterioration due to flooding, and a second fort was built in 1725.  Like the first fort, this second one was built from logs and was similarly susceptible to deterioration, and by 1742 the French constructed a new fort built from limestone.  Throughout the 1700s, the French debated whether Kaskaskia or Fort de Chartres should be the primary trading post and fortification, and eventually the latter became the military post.  After 1763, the British renamed Fort de Chartres "Fort Cavendish," but found little use for it and, by the 1800s, the site had fallen into disrepair.  This photo shows the reconstructed fort.

	<![CDATA[Fort Detroit (or Fort Ponchartrain du Detroit) was established on the Detroit River in 1701 by French officer Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, who wanted to build trade alliances with local Indians.  Until 1760, when the British assumed control, the site was an important trading hub for Indian groups and Europeans.  Trade alliances deteriorated as a result of the harsh practices of the British.  During Pontiac’s Rebellion of 1763, Fort Detroit was one of the few forts not to fall to Pontiac’s forces.  In 1796, the Americans assumed control of Fort Detroit.  Painting, "A View of Detroit.

Located at the juncture of the Great Sauk Trail (an old trade route running east-west) and the Grand River Trail (a north-south route), this fort protected the fur trade against English incursions at the south end of Lake Michigan in later years.  In 1761, the British assumed control of the fort, and in 1763, during Pontiac’s Rebellion, the Potawatomi Indians captured it.  Later, the fort was an important trading post, eventually abandoned by the British in 1795.  Courtesy of the Fort St. Joseph Museum, Niles, Michigan]]>

	<![CDATA[Built by the French around 1715 along the southern shore of the Straits of Mackinac, Fort Michilimackinac was a key link in the French fur trading system. The French traded with the Native inhabitants, including Ottawa and Ojibwa, until 1761, when they relinquished the fort to the British.  The site remained an important trading post under the British.  In 1763, a group of Pontiac’s followers staged a game of lacrosse (or, baaga’adowe) as a ruse to enter the fort.  This attack was part of a larger front known as Pontiac’s Rebellion.  The Ojibwa held the fort for a year before the British retook and dismantled the wooden structure.  In 1781, the British built Fort Mackinac on nearby Mackinac Island. “Michilimackinack, 1836,” watercolor drawing by Seth Eastman, in Henry R.

It was on the St. Marys River trade route and the falls area was the source of huge numbers of whitefish, so the place became a main trade and ceremonial center, especially in the summer.  In the early 1660s, French traders from Montreal established a base there and Jesuit missionaries founded a mission and called it Sault Ste. Marie in 1668.

By this time, the settlement, now known as Baie Verte or Green Bay, was a thriving multiethnic trading community in which Métis played a central role.  By the mid-18th century, Green Bay was the third most lucrative trading post, behind Detroit and Michilimackinac.

Several Ojibwa villages were located throughout the area that was called Chequamegon and La Pointe.  The word Chequamegon is derived from an Ojibwa word for "at the sand bar."  As the French established trading posts here, they relied on the Ojibwa not only to obtain pelts, but also to bring in furs from the Dakota to the southwest.  In 1659, a post was built at Chequamegon.  In 1693, the French built a fort on Madeline Island, the largest island in Chequamegon Bay, and they called this site La Pointe.  The fort was abandoned by 1700, but was rebuilt in 1718.  Here the French traded and explored the copper mines in the region.  In 1759, the first English trader, Alexander Henry, established a post on the site.  In 1818, Lyman and Truman Warren came from Massachusetts to become the first American traders at Chequamegon and La Pointe.  Oil sketch, "Grant’s Point, Madeline Island," by David Geister.

In 1685, French explorer Nicolas Perrot established a trading post along the Mississippi River at Prairie du Chien.  After the emergence of the fur trade, Indians of the region viewed the site as neutral ground where many ethnic groups gathered to trade.  After the British defeated the French in 1763, the settlement became a multiethnic trading community in which Métis played a central role.  When the Americans defeated the British in 1816, Fort Crawford was constructed on the site and in 1825, 1829, and 1830 treaties were signed here by the United States and groups from the Sioux, Sauk, Fox, Menominee, Winnebago, and Ojibwa.

In 1686 French explorer Nicolas Perrot established Fort St. Antoine, the first European trading post of this region.  In 1699, Pierre-Charles Le Sueur traveled up the Mississippi to Lake Pepin and traded with bands of Dakota Indians that occupied the area.  The French built Fort Beauharnois in 1727 and then rebuilt the fort on higher ground in 1730.  In 1737, the Dakota attacked the fort, and the French burned it down before they fled.  In 1750, Fort la Jonquière was built on the site, but this fort too was abandoned when the French troops stationed there were sent east to fight the British in the French and Indian War.

		<![CDATA["Sandusky" was the term applied by Indians to the region and the villages on the site in the late 17th century.  In the 1730s there were Wyandot refugees living here in several villages.  Their leader was antagonistic to the French, so in 1745 he allowed the English to erect a post known as Fort Sandoski at his principal town on the Sandusky River.  The French reacted and he withdrew to Illinois country.  Following the French and Indian War, the victorious British began building forts in the Great Lakes region.  Fort Sandusky was rebuilt here in 1761 to connect the Sandusky Bay area, an important trade hub, to Fort Detroit and Fort Pitt in Pennsylvania.   In 1763, during Pontiac’s Rebellion, the Wyandots easily sacked and burned the lightly guarded fort.  Fort Sandusky was located near the Sandusky River and Lake Erie.

The French built the fort to protect the trade routes and to trade regularly with the Miami, who also were inclined to trade with the English, playing off the traders against each other for the best terms.  Fort Miami served as a French trading post until 1747, when the English-allied Hurons sacked and destroyed the fort.  Rebuilt by the British soon after, the fort was again destroyed in 1763 during Pontiac’s Rebellion.  Again rebuilt, Fort Miami became a successful trading post until the Revolutionary War.  The Americans built Ft. Wayne on this site.  This manuscript map of Fort Wayne (“Indiana Fort Wayne”) reportedly was made by P. M. Neff on July 18, 1795 for General Anthony Wayne.

However, by the 1700s, the area was inhabited primarily by the Potawatomis.  Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, a man of mixed African and European ancestry, founded the first trading post and married a Potawatomi woman in the 1770s.  Following the Treaty of Greenville in 1795, the area was ceded to the Americans, who built Fort Dearborn here in 1803.  "Chicago," drawn by Seth Eastman, in Henry R.

	<![CDATA[During their 1673 voyage, Marquette and Jolliet encountered Illinois Indians at their village, Kaskaskia.  In 1703, Kaskaskia became a Jesuit missionary post.  The settlement grew throughout the 1770s as the site became an important fur trade hub.  Fort de Chartres actually refers to three forts that were built by the French near the Mississippi River between 1720 and 1763.  The first Fort de Chartres was completed in 1720 and was intended to seat the Company of the Indies and the French government of the Illinois country and to control the Indians of the region (primarily the Fox).  Built close to the river, the fort saw deterioration due to flooding, and a second fort was built in 1725.  Like the first fort, this second one was built from logs and was similarly susceptible to deterioration, and by 1742 the French constructed a new fort built from limestone.  Throughout the 1700s, the French debated whether Kaskaskia or Fort de Chartres should be the primary trading post and fortification, and eventually the latter became the military post.  After 1763, the British renamed Fort de Chartres "Fort Cavendish," but found little use for it and, by the 1800s, the site had fallen into disrepair.  This photo shows the reconstructed fort.

Until 1760, when the British assumed control, the site was an important trading hub for Indian groups and Europeans.  Trade alliances deteriorated as a result of the harsh practices of the British.  During Pontiac’s Rebellion of 1763, Fort Detroit was one of the few forts not to fall to Pontiac’s forces.  In 1796, the Americans assumed control of Fort Detroit.  Painting, "A View of Detroit.

Located at the juncture of the Great Sauk Trail (an old trade route running east-west) and the Grand River Trail (a north-south route), this fort protected the fur trade against English incursions at the south end of Lake Michigan in later years.  In 1761, the British assumed control of the fort, and in 1763, during Pontiac’s Rebellion, the Potawatomi Indians captured it.  Later, the fort was an important trading post, eventually abandoned by the British in 1795.  Courtesy of the Fort St. Joseph Museum, Niles, Michigan]]>

	<![CDATA[Built by the French around 1715 along the southern shore of the Straits of Mackinac, Fort Michilimackinac was a key link in the French fur trading system. The French traded with the Native inhabitants, including Ottawa and Ojibwa, until 1761, when they relinquished the fort to the British.  The site remained an important trading post under the British.  In 1763, a group of Pontiac’s followers staged a game of lacrosse (or, baaga’adowe) as a ruse to enter the fort.  This attack was part of a larger front known as Pontiac’s Rebellion.  The Ojibwa held the fort for a year before the British retook and dismantled the wooden structure.  In 1781, the British built Fort Mackinac on nearby Mackinac Island. “Michilimackinack, 1836,” watercolor drawing by Seth Eastman, in Henry R.

By the mid-18th century, Green Bay was the third most lucrative trading post, behind Detroit and Michilimackinac.

Several Ojibwa villages were located throughout the area that was called Chequamegon and La Pointe.  The word Chequamegon is derived from an Ojibwa word for "at the sand bar."  As the French established trading posts here, they relied on the Ojibwa not only to obtain pelts, but also to bring in furs from the Dakota to the southwest.  In 1659, a post was built at Chequamegon.  In 1693, the French built a fort on Madeline Island, the largest island in Chequamegon Bay, and they called this site La Pointe.  The fort was abandoned by 1700, but was rebuilt in 1718.  Here the French traded and explored the copper mines in the region.  In 1759, the first English trader, Alexander Henry, established a post on the site.  In 1818, Lyman and Truman Warren came from Massachusetts to become the first American traders at Chequamegon and La Pointe.  Oil sketch, "Grant’s Point, Madeline Island," by David Geister.

In 1685, French explorer Nicolas Perrot established a trading post along the Mississippi River at Prairie du Chien.  After the emergence of the fur trade, Indians of the region viewed the site as neutral ground where many ethnic groups gathered to trade.  After the British defeated the French in 1763, the settlement became a multiethnic trading community in which Métis played a central role.  When the Americans defeated the British in 1816, Fort Crawford was constructed on the site and in 1825, 1829, and 1830 treaties were signed here by the United States and groups from the Sioux, Sauk, Fox, Menominee, Winnebago, and Ojibwa.

In 1686 French explorer Nicolas Perrot established Fort St. Antoine, the first European trading post of this region.  In 1699, Pierre-Charles Le Sueur traveled up the Mississippi to Lake Pepin and traded with bands of Dakota Indians that occupied the area.  The French built Fort Beauharnois in 1727 and then rebuilt the fort on higher ground in 1730.  In 1737, the Dakota attacked the fort, and the French burned it down before they fled.  In 1750, Fort la Jonquière was built on the site, but this fort too was abandoned when the French troops stationed there were sent east to fight the British in the French and Indian War.

		<![CDATA["Sandusky" was the term applied by Indians to the region and the villages on the site in the late 17th century.  In the 1730s there were Wyandot refugees living here in several villages.  Their leader was antagonistic to the French, so in 1745 he allowed the English to erect a post known as Fort Sandoski at his principal town on the Sandusky River.  The French reacted and he withdrew to Illinois country.  Following the French and Indian War, the victorious British began building forts in the Great Lakes region.  Fort Sandusky was rebuilt here in 1761 to connect the Sandusky Bay area, an important trade hub, to Fort Detroit and Fort Pitt in Pennsylvania.   In 1763, during Pontiac’s Rebellion, the Wyandots easily sacked and burned the lightly guarded fort.  Fort Sandusky was located near the Sandusky River and Lake Erie.

The French built the fort to protect the trade routes and to trade regularly with the Miami, who also were inclined to trade with the English, playing off the traders against each other for the best terms.  Fort Miami served as a French trading post until 1747, when the English-allied Hurons sacked and destroyed the fort.  Rebuilt by the British soon after, the fort was again destroyed in 1763 during Pontiac’s Rebellion.  Again rebuilt, Fort Miami became a successful trading post until the Revolutionary War.  The Americans built Ft. Wayne on this site.  This manuscript map of Fort Wayne (“Indiana Fort Wayne”) reportedly was made by P. M. Neff on July 18, 1795 for General Anthony Wayne.

Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, a man of mixed African and European ancestry, founded the first trading post and married a Potawatomi woman in the 1770s.  Following the Treaty of Greenville in 1795, the area was ceded to the Americans, who built Fort Dearborn here in 1803.  "Chicago," drawn by Seth Eastman, in Henry R.

	<![CDATA[During their 1673 voyage, Marquette and Jolliet encountered Illinois Indians at their village, Kaskaskia.  In 1703, Kaskaskia became a Jesuit missionary post.  The settlement grew throughout the 1770s as the site became an important fur trade hub.  Fort de Chartres actually refers to three forts that were built by the French near the Mississippi River between 1720 and 1763.  The first Fort de Chartres was completed in 1720 and was intended to seat the Company of the Indies and the French government of the Illinois country and to control the Indians of the region (primarily the Fox).  Built close to the river, the fort saw deterioration due to flooding, and a second fort was built in 1725.  Like the first fort, this second one was built from logs and was similarly susceptible to deterioration, and by 1742 the French constructed a new fort built from limestone.  Throughout the 1700s, the French debated whether Kaskaskia or Fort de Chartres should be the primary trading post and fortification, and eventually the latter became the military post.  After 1763, the British renamed Fort de Chartres "Fort Cavendish," but found little use for it and, by the 1800s, the site had fallen into disrepair.  This photo shows the reconstructed fort.

Until 1760, when the British assumed control, the site was an important trading hub for Indian groups and Europeans.  Trade alliances deteriorated as a result of the harsh practices of the British.  During Pontiac’s Rebellion of 1763, Fort Detroit was one of the few forts not to fall to Pontiac’s forces.  In 1796, the Americans assumed control of Fort Detroit.  Painting, "A View of Detroit.

The French traded with the Native inhabitants, including Ottawa and Ojibwa, until 1761, when they relinquished the fort to the British.  The site remained an important trading post under the British.  In 1763, a group of Pontiac’s followers staged a game of lacrosse (or, baaga’adowe) as a ruse to enter the fort.  This attack was part of a larger front known as Pontiac’s Rebellion.  The Ojibwa held the fort for a year before the British retook and dismantled the wooden structure.  In 1781, the British built Fort Mackinac on nearby Mackinac Island. “Michilimackinack, 1836,” watercolor drawing by Seth Eastman, in Henry R.

Several Ojibwa villages were located throughout the area that was called Chequamegon and La Pointe.  The word Chequamegon is derived from an Ojibwa word for "at the sand bar."  As the French established trading posts here, they relied on the Ojibwa not only to obtain pelts, but also to bring in furs from the Dakota to the southwest.  In 1659, a post was built at Chequamegon.  In 1693, the French built a fort on Madeline Island, the largest island in Chequamegon Bay, and they called this site La Pointe.  The fort was abandoned by 1700, but was rebuilt in 1718.  Here the French traded and explored the copper mines in the region.  In 1759, the first English trader, Alexander Henry, established a post on the site.  In 1818, Lyman and Truman Warren came from Massachusetts to become the first American traders at Chequamegon and La Pointe.  Oil sketch, "Grant’s Point, Madeline Island," by David Geister.

In 1685, French explorer Nicolas Perrot established a trading post along the Mississippi River at Prairie du Chien.  After the emergence of the fur trade, Indians of the region viewed the site as neutral ground where many ethnic groups gathered to trade.  After the British defeated the French in 1763, the settlement became a multiethnic trading community in which Métis played a central role.  When the Americans defeated the British in 1816, Fort Crawford was constructed on the site and in 1825, 1829, and 1830 treaties were signed here by the United States and groups from the Sioux, Sauk, Fox, Menominee, Winnebago, and Ojibwa.

In 1686 French explorer Nicolas Perrot established Fort St. Antoine, the first European trading post of this region.  In 1699, Pierre-Charles Le Sueur traveled up the Mississippi to Lake Pepin and traded with bands of Dakota Indians that occupied the area.  The French built Fort Beauharnois in 1727 and then rebuilt the fort on higher ground in 1730.  In 1737, the Dakota attacked the fort, and the French burned it down before they fled.  In 1750, Fort la Jonquière was built on the site, but this fort too was abandoned when the French troops stationed there were sent east to fight the British in the French and Indian War.

Used for religious rituals from about 250 BC to AD 200, it was built on a high point near creeks and springs.  There are several mounds and embankments or enclosures, including the Great Mound and Circular Earthworks, and the Circle Mound and Rectangular Earthworks. Circle Mound is shown here.  It is contained within the Rectangular Earthworks, which had three enclosures.  The Circle Mound (5 BC-70 AD) was oriented to the sunrise at the equinox, and the enclosure was aligned with the sunrise and sunset at the summer and winter solstice.  This enclosure is 285 feet long, 225 feet wide, 6 feet high, with a gateway at the east end.  The embankment was constructed to allow people to view the rising and setting of the sun, moon, and brighter stars as well as the Pleiades Constellation.  The mound is 148 feet long and 72 feet wide.  The Great Mound is one of eight contained within the Circular Earthworks.  This mound has a 350 feet diameter.  It was a natural mound around which a ditch 60 feet wide and 10 feet deep was constructed.  Over time, people from different communities brought the remains of certain deceased persons (presumably leaders of family groups) to be reburied here.  Pilgrims also came for other kinds of ceremonies, bringing offerings.  There once were hundreds of sites of similar earthworks in Indiana that shared religious symbolism. This mound complex is located in Mounds State Park near Anderson.  Photo courtesy of Archaeological Resources Management Service, Ball State University.]]></caption>

Several thousand people lived in this town, growing corn in the rich bottom land of the Ohio River.  The administrative center was protected by a stockade made of wattle and daub.  Inside was a plaza surrounded by three major platform mounds and eight other mounds.  The elite families lived on top of the platform mounds. The ordinary farmers lived in square houses, the corners of which were oriented to the four cardinal directions.  A temple was on top of one of the large mounds, where elite ceremonial authorities presided over rituals.  This was a regional center ruled by a warrior-noble.  Satellite villages extended out for many miles, and the elites participated in a far-reaching trade network of valuable objects.  The site is named after the landowner, Mathias Angel.

Certainly an important gathering place for mortuary activities sometime between 700-1200 AD, the site has three bird, 2 panther (water spirit), 2 bear, one deer, and several conical mounds.  The site is in what was once a food-rich region on Lake Mendota near Madison.  There were at least 800 groups of effigy mounds in eastern and west-central Wisconsin, the heartland of effigy mound culture.  These centers often were associated with sites where conical mounds were constructed much earlier, an indication that the builders of the effigy mounds recognized the sacred character of a place over a long period of time.

Today it is three miles northwest of Chillicothe, Ohio and is one of five sites within the Hopewell Culture National Historical Park in Ross County.  The rectangular earthwork encloses 13 acres and contains at least 24 mounds.  The enclosure is about four feet high and has gateways on the east and west.  The largest mound has a diameter of 90 feet and a height of 18 feet.  The mounds covered structures used for burials, and the sacred space within the enclosure probably was used for rituals .  In one of the mounds was a large cache of animal effigy pipes, mostly in the form of birds and land animals, that had been left as offerings, probably by family groups or groups of religious leaders.  While there were other ceremonial centers in Ohio at this time, there also were small communities that apparently lacked interest in the ceremonies held at the centers.  Today the site is managed  by the National Park Service. The name "Hopewell" comes from Mordecai Hopewell, who was the landowner in the 1890s of one the earthwork sites in the Park.

The largest of the ceremonial centers during this time, it covered more than four square miles and consisted of geometrical earthworks and conical mounds. The Great Circle Earthwork was 5 to 14 feet high with a diameter of 1,200 feet.  It encompassed 30 acres and in the center was a large building with an altar. The Octagon contained 50 acres (large enough to hold four Roman Colosseums), and the Observatory Circle had a diameter of 1,054 feet and contained 20 acres.  From points on the Observatory Circle and Octagon (shown in this photo), the moon could be tracked across the sky throughout its 18.6 year-long cycle.  An ellipse  surrounded numerous conical mounds up to about 20 feet high and these contained burials.  Parallel walls or passageways connected the principle enclosures and the waterways by which many of the pilgrims came to the center.  Parallel walls also stretched toward another ceremonial center some 60 miles to the southwest.  In the center of the complex there was a pond.  Sky, earth, and water symbolism figured importantly in the rituals held inside the enclosures.  The architecture was not haphazard.  Rather, there were geometrical relationships between earthworks. For example, the circumference of the Great Circle equaled the perimeter of the large square enclosure at the site.

It was built by people from a nearby farming village community about 900 years ago and used as a sacred site for over a hundred years.  The earth sculpture is 1,348 feet long from tip to tip. There were burial mounds nearby but the Serpent Mound was a monumental calendar and a place for rituals probably designed to generate life.  The sculpture probably represented the Horned Serpent, a spirit being associated with the underworld.  In molting, the snake is reborn and, in its association with water, is linked to rain and fertility. The coils of the snake were aligned with the summer and winter solstice sunrises and the equinox sunrise, so the sun�s cycle could be tracked here. The head is aligned to the summer solstice sunset.

In 1150, it was larger than London was at that time. Cahokia covered about 6 square miles with 120 mounds, and from 1175-1275, its administrative center was fortified with a defensive stockade built in four stages.  Here the elite lived around the Grand Plaza, where they conducted ceremonies, supervised public works, and probably distributed crops from granaries replenished by Cahokia�s farmers and tribute from surrounding villages.   Outside this administrative center was a residential area largely for non-elites who lived in family compounds.  This photo shows Monks Mound facing the Fox and Round Top Mounds, known as the "Twin Mounds." Monks Mound stood ten stories high and had pole and thatch buildings used by the ruler for various activities.  To the south was the rectangular Fox Mound, 160 feet long, 125 feet wide, and 46 feet high.  It probably was the base for a structure that contained the remains of members of some of the elite, and it was associated with Round Top Mound, which was 44 feet high and which may have been another place for elite burials.

		<![CDATA[This was once a ceremonial center on the eastern edge of White River.  Used for religious rituals from about 250 B.C. to A.D. 200, it was built on a high point near creeks and springs.  There are several mounds and embankments or enclosures, including the Great Mound and Circular Earthworks, and the Circle Mound and Rectangular Earthworks. Circle Mound is shown here.  It is contained within the Rectangular Earthworks, which had three enclosures.  The Circle Mound (5 B.C.- A.D. 70) was oriented to the sunrise at the equinox, and the enclosure was aligned with the sunrise and sunset at the summer and winter solstice.  This enclosure is 285 feet long, 225 feet wide, and 6 feet high, with a gateway at the east end.  The embankment was constructed to allow people to view the rising and setting of the sun, moon, and brighter stars as well as the Pleiades Constellation.  The mound is 148 feet long and 72 feet wide.  The Great Mound is one of eight contained within the Circular Earthworks.  This mound has a diameter of 350 feet.  It was a natural mound around which a ditch 60 feet wide and 10 feet deep was constructed.  Over time, people from different communities brought the remains of certain deceased persons (presumably leaders of family groups) to be reburied here.  Pilgrims also came for other kinds of ceremonies, bringing offerings.  There once were hundreds of sites of similar earthworks in Indiana that shared religious symbolism. This mound complex is located in Mounds State Park near Anderson.  Photo courtesy of Archaeological Resources Management Service, Ball State University]]>

Several thousand people lived in this town, growing corn in the rich bottom land of the Ohio River.  The administrative center was protected by a stockade made of wattle and daub.  Inside was a plaza surrounded by three major platform mounds and eight other mounds.  The elite families lived on top of the platform mounds. The ordinary farmers lived in square houses, the corners of which were oriented to the four cardinal directions.  A temple was on top of one of the large mounds, where elite ceremonial authorities presided over rituals.  This was a regional center ruled by a warrior-noble.  Satellite villages extended out for many miles, and the elites participated in a far-reaching trade network of valuable objects.  The site is named after the landowner, Mathias Angel.

The site is in what was once a food-rich region on Lake Mendota near Madison.  There were at least 800 groups of effigy mounds in eastern and west-central Wisconsin, the heartland of effigy mound culture.

Today it is three miles northwest of Chillicothe, Ohio and is one of five sites within the Hopewell Culture National Historical Park in Ross County.  The rectangular earthwork encloses 13 acres and contains at least 24 mounds.  The enclosure is about four feet high and has gateways on the east and west.  The largest mound has a diameter of 90 feet and a height of 18 feet.  The mounds covered structures used for burials, and the sacred space within the enclosure probably was used for rituals.  In one of the mounds was a large cache of animal effigy pipes, mostly in the form of birds and land animals, that had been left as offerings, probably by family groups or groups of religious leaders.  While there were other ceremonial centers in Ohio at this time, there also were small communities that apparently lacked interest in the ceremonies held at the centers.

The largest of the ceremonial centers during this time, it covered more than four square miles and consisted of geometrical earthworks and conical mounds. The Great Circle Earthwork was 5 to 14 feet high with a diameter of 1,200 feet.  It encompassed 30 acres and in the center was a large building with an altar. The Octagon contained 50 acres (large enough to hold four Roman Coliseums), and the Observatory Circle had a diameter of 1,054 feet and contained 20 acres.  From points on the Observatory Circle and Octagon (shown in this photo), the moon could be tracked across the sky throughout its 18.6 year-long cycle.  An ellipse surrounded numerous conical mounds up to about 20 feet high and these contained burials.  Parallel walls or passageways connected the principal enclosures and the waterways by which many of the pilgrims came to the center.  Parallel walls also stretched toward another ceremonial center some 60 miles to the southwest.  In the center of the complex there was a pond.  Sky, earth, and water symbolism figured importantly in the rituals held inside the enclosures.  The architecture was not haphazard.  Rather, there were geometrical relationships between earthworks. For example, the circumference of the Great Circle equaled the perimeter of the large square enclosure at the site.  All that remains of this remarkable center is the Great Circle, Octagon and Circle, and fragments of the Square.  The embankments have been incorporated into the nearby town of Newark, with the Octagon used as a golf course.  Today the Newark Earthworks is recognized as a National Historic Landmark.

		<![CDATA["Sandusky" was the term applied by Indians to the region and the villages on the site in the late 17th century.  In the 1730s there were Wyandot refugees living here in several villages.  Their leader was antagonistic to the French, so in 1745 he allowed the English to erect a post known as Fort Sandoski at his principal town on the Sandusky River.  The French reacted and he withdrew to Illinois country.  Following the French and Indian War, the victorious British began building forts in the Great Lakes region.  Fort Sandusky was rebuilt here in 1761 to connect the Sandusky Bay area, an important trade hub, to Fort Detroit and Fort Pitt in Pennsylvania.   In 1763, during Pontiac’s Rebellion, the Wyandots easily sacked and burned the lightly guarded fort.  Fort Sandusky was located near the Sandusky River and Lake Erie.

	<![CDATA[Fort Miami was built by the French in 1715 near Kekionga, a large Miami village at the convergence of the St. Joseph, St. Marys, and Maumee Rivers.  The French built the fort to protect the trade routes and to trade regularly with the Miami, who also were inclined to trade with the English, playing off the traders against each other for the best terms.  Fort Miami served as a French trading post until 1747, when the English-allied Hurons sacked and destroyed the fort.  Rebuilt by the British soon after, the fort was again destroyed in 1763 during Pontiac’s Rebellion.  Again rebuilt, Fort Miami became a successful trading post until the Revolutionary War.  The Americans built Ft. Wayne on this site.  This manuscript map of Fort Wayne (“Indiana Fort Wayne”) reportedly was made by P. M. Neff on July 18, 1795 for General Anthony Wayne.

		<![CDATA[Early inhabitants of Chicago included Miamis, as well as the Sauk and Fox and their Mascouten allies, and the Potawatomis and Illinois whose migrations and trade links brought them to the region.  However, by the 1700s, the area was inhabited primarily by the Potawatomis.  Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, a man of mixed African and European ancestry, founded the first trading post and married a Potawatomi woman in the 1770s.  Following the Treaty of Greenville in 1795, the area was ceded to the Americans, who built Fort Dearborn here in 1803.  "Chicago," drawn by Seth Eastman, in Henry R.

	<![CDATA[During their 1673 voyage, Marquette and Jolliet encountered Illinois Indians at their village, Kaskaskia.  In 1703, Kaskaskia became a Jesuit missionary post.  The settlement grew throughout the 1770s as the site became an important fur trade hub.  Fort de Chartres actually refers to three forts that were built by the French near the Mississippi River between 1720 and 1763.  The first Fort de Chartres was completed in 1720 and was intended to seat the Company of the Indies and the French government of the Illinois country and to control the Indians of the region (primarily the Fox).  Built close to the river, the fort saw deterioration due to flooding, and a second fort was built in 1725.  Like the first fort, this second one was built from logs and was similarly susceptible to deterioration, and by 1742 the French constructed a new fort built from limestone.  Throughout the 1700s, the French debated whether Kaskaskia or Fort de Chartres should be the primary trading post and fortification, and eventually the latter became the military post.  After 1763, the British renamed Fort de Chartres "Fort Cavendish," but found little use for it and, by the 1800s, the site had fallen into disrepair.  This photo shows the reconstructed fort.

	<![CDATA[Fort Detroit (or Fort Ponchartrain du Detroit) was established on the Detroit River in 1701 by French officer Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, who wanted to build trade alliances with local Indians.  Until 1760, when the British assumed control, the site was an important trading hub for Indian groups and Europeans.  Trade alliances deteriorated as a result of the harsh practices of the British.  During Pontiac’s Rebellion of 1763, Fort Detroit was one of the few forts not to fall to Pontiac’s forces.  In 1796, the Americans assumed control of Fort Detroit.  Painting, "A View of Detroit.

Located at the juncture of the Great Sauk Trail (an old trade route running east-west) and the Grand River Trail (a north-south route), this fort protected the fur trade against English incursions at the south end of Lake Michigan in later years.  In 1761, the British assumed control of the fort, and in 1763, during Pontiac’s Rebellion, the Potawatomi Indians captured it.  Later, the fort was an important trading post, eventually abandoned by the British in 1795.  Courtesy of the Fort St. Joseph Museum, Niles, Michigan]]>

	<![CDATA[Built by the French around 1715 along the southern shore of the Straits of Mackinac, Fort Michilimackinac was a key link in the French fur trading system. The French traded with the Native inhabitants, including Ottawa and Ojibwa, until 1761, when they relinquished the fort to the British.  The site remained an important trading post under the British.  In 1763, a group of Pontiac’s followers staged a game of lacrosse (or, baaga’adowe) as a ruse to enter the fort.  This attack was part of a larger front known as Pontiac’s Rebellion.  The Ojibwa held the fort for a year before the British retook and dismantled the wooden structure.  In 1781, the British built Fort Mackinac on nearby Mackinac Island. “Michilimackinack, 1836,” watercolor drawing by Seth Eastman, in Henry R.

By this time, the settlement, now known as Baie Verte or Green Bay, was a thriving multiethnic trading community in which Métis played a central role.  By the mid-18th century, Green Bay was the third most lucrative trading post, behind Detroit and Michilimackinac.

Several Ojibwa villages were located throughout the area that was called Chequamegon and La Pointe.  The word Chequamegon is derived from an Ojibwa word for "at the sand bar."  As the French established trading posts here, they relied on the Ojibwa not only to obtain pelts, but also to bring in furs from the Dakota to the southwest.  In 1659, a post was built at Chequamegon.  In 1693, the French built a fort on Madeline Island, the largest island in Chequamegon Bay, and they called this site La Pointe.  The fort was abandoned by 1700, but was rebuilt in 1718.  Here the French traded and explored the copper mines in the region.  In 1759, the first English trader, Alexander Henry, established a post on the site.  In 1818, Lyman and Truman Warren came from Massachusetts to become the first American traders at Chequamegon and La Pointe.  Oil sketch, "Grant’s Point, Madeline Island," by David Geister.

In 1685, French explorer Nicolas Perrot established a trading post along the Mississippi River at Prairie du Chien.  After the emergence of the fur trade, Indians of the region viewed the site as neutral ground where many ethnic groups gathered to trade.  After the British defeated the French in 1763, the settlement became a multiethnic trading community in which Métis played a central role.  When the Americans defeated the British in 1816, Fort Crawford was constructed on the site and in 1825, 1829, and 1830 treaties were signed here by the United States and groups from the Sioux, Sauk, Fox, Menominee, Winnebago, and Ojibwa.

In 1686 French explorer Nicolas Perrot established Fort St. Antoine, the first European trading post of this region.  In 1699, Pierre-Charles Le Sueur traveled up the Mississippi to Lake Pepin and traded with bands of Dakota Indians that occupied the area.  The French built Fort Beauharnois in 1727 and then rebuilt the fort on higher ground in 1730.  In 1737, the Dakota attacked the fort, and the French burned it down before they fled.  In 1750, Fort la Jonquière was built on the site, but this fort too was abandoned when the French troops stationed there were sent east to fight the British in the French and Indian War.

	<![CDATA[This quarry in southwest Minnesota is the site of an important source of pipestone.  Layers of mottled pink to brick red pipestone are sandwiched between layers of Sioux Quertzite rock covered by prairie plants and soil.  For at least 3,000 years Native Americans have quarried pipestone here.  In the 18th and early 19th centuries, the quarry was in Dakota territory but the Dakotas did not restrict access to the sacred quarry by other peoples.  The stone and pipes made from it have been found throughout the continent.  At the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux in 1851, the Dakota ceded their territory, including the pipestone quarry, but other Sioux tribes, including the Yankton, had rights there.  The Yankton (from South Dakota) signed a cession treaty in 1858, in which they retained a 650-acre reserve at the quarry. In 1937 the quarry area became the Pipestone National Monument, where Native Americans from federally recognized tribes, had the right to quarry.  The Upper Midwest Culture Center there offers programs for the public, including demonstrations by Native American carvers.  The Monument is on the National Register of Historic Places.

Families use the rice for ceremonial purposes as well as for food, and some of the rice is sold.  The lake attracts game birds and animals.  Spirit Island sits in Nett Lake.
